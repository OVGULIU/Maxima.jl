# Getting Started

## Installation

Maxima.jl is not a registered package as yet and so it must be cloned from the 
github repository.

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/nsmith5/Maxima.jl.git")
```

Maxima.jl also requires a working installation of Maxima. Maxima can be 
installed by grabbing the appropriate installer 
[here](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/download.html). On most Linux distributions, you 
can also install Maxima through your distribution's repositories.
